## Description

_This is a weekly independent project for week 3 of Epicodus' Introduction to Programming Course: Arrays and Looping. The proejct prompt is:_

_Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:_

* _Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"_
* _Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"_
* _Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
* _These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,_

* _The number 13 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
* _The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop"._
* _The number 32 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
* _A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again._
