## Description

_This is a weekly independent project for week 3 of Epicodus' Introduction to Programming Course: Arrays and Looping. The project prompt is:_

_Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:_

* _Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"_
* _Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"_
* _Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
* _These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,_

* _The number 13 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
* _The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop"._
* _The number 32 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
* _A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again._

## Tests

_Describe: numberConverter()_
_Test: "It converts inputs containing 1 to \"Beep!\""_
_Expect (yourFunctionName(1)).toEqual("Beep!");_

_Test: "It converts inputs containing 2 to \"Boop!\""_
_Expect (yourFunctionName(2)).toEqual("Boop");_

_Test: "It converts inputs containing 3 to \"Won't you be my neighbor?\""_
_Expect (yourFunctionName(3)).toEqual("Won't you be my neighbor?");_

_Test: "It prioritizes converting 2 over converting 1 when converting numbers containing 1 and 2"_
_Expect (yourFunctionName(12)).toEqual("Boop");_

_Test: "It prioritizes converting 3 over converting 1 or 2 when converting numbers containing 1 or 2 and 3"_
_Expect (yourFunctionName(13)).toEqual("Won't you be my neighbor?");_

_Describe: outputGenerator()_
_Test: "It ouputs a list of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number substituting in the conversions generated by numberConverter()"_
_Expect (yourFunctionName(23)).toEqual(Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, "Beep", "Boop", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "Beep", "Beep", "Beep", "Beep", "Beep", "Beep", "Boop!", "Boop!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?");_

_Test: "It allows for consecutive inputs"_
_Expect (yourFunctionName(secondInput)).toEqual(newOutput);_

_Describe: numberIdentifier()_
_Test: "It recognizes when input is not a number and prompts user for a number"_
_Expect (yourFunctionName("hello")).toEqual("Please enter a number.");_
